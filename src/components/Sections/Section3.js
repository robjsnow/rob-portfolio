                <h2>Aliens vs Robots</h2>
            <p>
            Aliens vs Robots is a game I programmed in React, created especially for my five-year-old son to enjoy. In this project, my wife also played a significant role, and my son contributed by playtesting it. This game highlights my expertise in frontend web development, specifically in React and JavaScript/JSX, with an emphasis on game development.
