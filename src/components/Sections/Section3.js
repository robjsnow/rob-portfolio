                <h2>Aliens vs Robots</h2>
            <p>
              Aliens vs Robots is a game that I programmed in React for the enjoyment of my five year old son to play.
              I colloborated with my wife who gathered the assets and designed the game, and my son who playtested it.
              It demonstrates my proficiency in frontend web development: React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/JSX.
